TODOS:

Code up new cards interactions

1. Understand simulator (how to interact with cards)
2. Grab card data from hsreplay -> predict which cards opponent has in hand
3. come up with model/algorithm to tackle task
4. Write MDP for our simulator
5. Write a feature extractor 
6. Write minimax agent 
7. WRite eval function
8. TEst simulator
9. Write up with results

CS229:

Write a feature extractor: How to?
Scrape data from hsreplays for which cards belong to which decks
Write neural net? Or basic softmax classification to start?
Predict which cards are played next -> softmax again?
work on write up DUE MONDAY
